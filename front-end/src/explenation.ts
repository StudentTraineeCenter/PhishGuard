    'Message': `Phishing emails are one of the most common phishing methods. While they may look legitimate at first glance, they usually contain warning signs that reveal their fraudulent nature. 
        • What to Watch Out For: 
        • Suspicious Sender 
        • The sender's email address may be slightly altered, such as "@bankk.com" instead of "@bank.com". 
        • Urgency and Pressure 
        • Attackers often push for quick action, claiming, "Your account will be blocked if you don’t act immediately." 
        • Poor Grammar or Style 
        • Typos, strange sentence structures, or awkward phrasing are common in phishing emails. 
        • Attachments or Links 
        • Emails may include attachments that contain malicious software or links to fake websites. 
        • Generic Greetings 
        • Instead of addressing you by name, the email might use phrases like "Dear Customer." `,
    'Wrong time': `The timing of this email is suspicious for these reasons:
        • Sent outside normal business hours (typically 9 AM - 5 PM)
        • Timestamp doesn't align with the sender's known timezone
        • Urgent requests sent at odd hours to pressure quick responses
        • Inconsistent timing with the content or claimed urgency`,
    'Wrong sender name': `The sender's identity is suspicious because:
        • The display name mimics a legitimate organization
        • Email domain doesn't match the official company domain
        • Subtle misspellings or character substitutions in the name
        • Inconsistent formatting compared to genuine communications`,
    'Wrong domain': `The email domain is suspicious because:
        • Domain closely resembles a legitimate company but contains misspellings
        • Recently registered domain (less than 6 months old)
        • Domain hosted in unexpected or high-risk countries
        • Unusual or non-standard top-level domain (TLD)
        • Domain uses hyphens or numbers to mimic legitimate addresses`
